# Online-Examination
The **Online Exam System** is a console-based Java application that simulates an online examination platform with the following functionalities:

1. **Login:** Users authenticate using a valid user ID and password.
2. **Update Profile and Password:** Users can update their personal details (name and email) and change their password for enhanced security.
3. **Exam Functionality:** Users can participate in an exam by answering multiple-choice questions (MCQs). A timer ensures automatic submission when the time limit is reached.
4. **Session Management:** After completing tasks or exams, users can log out to securely end their session.

The system uses object-oriented principles, featuring classes like `User` for user management and `ExamSystem` for handling exam-related functionalities. It ensures a smooth and secure workflow, ideal for small-scale exam platforms or learning projects.
